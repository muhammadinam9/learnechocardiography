QUESTION: What is the relationship between wavelength and frequency in sound waves?
TOPIC: Sound Wave Fundamentals
SUBTOPIC: Wave Properties
DIFFICULTY: easy
OPTION A: They are directly proportional
OPTION B: They are inversely proportional
OPTION C: They have no relationship
OPTION D: They are logarithmically related
CORRECT: B
EXPLANATION: Wavelength and frequency are inversely proportional. As wavelength increases, frequency decreases, and vice versa.

QUESTION: In the context of sound waves, what is the formula for calculating the speed of sound?
TOPIC: Sound Wave Fundamentals
SUBTOPIC: Wave Equations
DIFFICULTY: medium
OPTION A: v = λ × f
OPTION B: v = λ / f
OPTION C: v = f / λ
OPTION D: v = λ + f
CORRECT: A
EXPLANATION: The speed of sound (v) equals the wavelength (λ) multiplied by the frequency (f).

QUESTION: What happens to the frequency of a sound wave when its source moves toward an observer?
TOPIC: Sound Wave Fundamentals
SUBTOPIC: Doppler Effect
DIFFICULTY: hard
OPTION A: Frequency decreases
OPTION B: Frequency remains the same
OPTION C: Frequency increases
OPTION D: Frequency becomes zero
CORRECT: C
EXPLANATION: When a sound source moves toward an observer, the frequency perceived by the observer increases. This is known as the Doppler effect.
